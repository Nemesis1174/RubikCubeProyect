In this project I will recreate a 3*3 Rubik's cube with three main classes, the first is the RubikCube, which consists of the possible movements of the cube, its impression and two possible ways of mixing it, one that is random and the other is by chance. means of a list given by the user. The second Heuristics class consists of three heuristics that I will use to solve the cube in a more optimal way, and the third class called RubikSolver consists of 4 algorithms with which I can solve the cube using the heuristics implemented above.
